This is a proof-of-concept of wrapping libhmsbeagle using SWIG to generate Python wrappers. This has been tested only on Linux; building the module can be done either by the shell script

bash ./build.sh

or by using python setuptools

python setup.py build_ext --inplace

You can then run a test, which is basically a 1:1 translation of hellobeagle:

python test.py

This prints out
-84.8523582328
Woof!

If you get a strange message like this:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 10, in <module>
    beagle_module = Extension("_beagle",sources=['beagle_wrap.c'],**pkgconfig('hmsbeagle-1'))
TypeError: __init__() keywords must be strings

it's probably because pkgconfig can't find hmsbeagle.
